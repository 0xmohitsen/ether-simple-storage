# Ether Simple Storage

## Overview

We worked on a **Simple Storage Contract** using Ethereum smart contracts.

### Key Focus Areas

-   Utilized **ethers.js** and **solc** to compile and deploy the contract locally.
-   Deployed the contract on a **local blockchain** environment using **Ganache**.
-   Followed **best practices** to secure private keys and `rpc_url`s.
